This c++ repository is associated with the paper DataLev: Mid-air Data Physicalisation Using Acoustic Levitation, providing the example implementations of physicalisations. 
https://doi.org/10.1145/3544548.3581016

DataLev is built based on the OpenMPD framework ([paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3572896), [source code](https://github.com/RMResearch/OpenMPD)), which provides the general driver and solver solutions.

Some example physicalisations require calling the external path planning algorithms written in python ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09052), [source code](https://github.com/jkchengh/s2m2)).
